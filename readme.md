## PURPOSE

The intent of this project is to:
1. Make it easy to verify the connection to [KOMBIT Serviceplatformen](https://www.serviceplatformen.dk), 
using the authoritycontext and invocationcontext security models.
2. Serve as an example on how to implement and configure a client to KOMBIT Serviceplatformen for the 
authoritycontext and invocationcontext security models.

## TARGET AUDIENCE

This file is targeted at developers who implement integrations to Serviceplatformen.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### PREREQUISITES

 * SoapUI 5.2.1 or higher is installed.
 
The client is fully configured and should work as is. The client is tested with SoapUI.

### CONFIG

1.	Configure keystore
In SoapUI go to:
File -> Preferences -> SSL settings
-	Key Store field. Specify the path to demoservice.jks located in same folder as this document. (e.g -
`<Folder placement>\demoservice.jks`
-	Password -  `wRFsRP63H3kNEhDU`

-   Get visual representation by ctrl + left-click the picture right below:

### CHANGE CERTIFICATE

If the keystore (.jks) needs to be changed, do as stated below with the given .jks file and change 
the password accordingly.

1. Open `demoservice.jks` for the relevant client with KeyStore Explorer or your favorite JKS manipulation tool.
2. Remove the existing private-public key pair.
3. Import your own key pair.
4. Make sure the password for the key pair is the same as the password for the entire Java KeyStore file.

### CONTENT

There are couple of files in this archive:

- `readme.md` - this file.
- `DemoService-exttest-soapui-project.xml` - xml file represents SOAP UI project and can be imported by that tool.
- `demoservice.jks` - Certificate-file as descriped in config.docx
- `resource\*` - images used for this readme.

The project contains two requests:
- `callDemoServcieWithInvocationContext`
- `callDemoServiceWithAuthorityContext`

### SIDENOTE
The SoapUI project does not contain an example request for the token security model. We instead refer to the Java client which can be found as a separate Serviceplatformen repository here on GitHub. 
The two other security models are covered in the SoapUI project.
